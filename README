A simple client to paste data onto Campfire.
Written in Haskell using GHC 7.0.3.

You'll need to "cabal install" the following:

	data-object-json
	base64-string
	http-enumerator

Then edit the source code and put in your own domain and API key.
Run "ghc --make hashfire" to get a binary.

Usage:  hashfire <room ID> <message>

Message can be "-", and it will read from standard input instead.
